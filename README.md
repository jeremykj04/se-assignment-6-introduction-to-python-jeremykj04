# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

   Python is a high-level programming language celebrated for its simplicity and readability. It's designed to be easy to understand and write, which makes it a favorite among developers. Python's dynamic typing, extensive standard library, and support for various programming styles contribute to its popularity. It's particularly effective for web development with frameworks like Django, for data analysis and machine learning through libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, and for automating tasks or scripting due to its straightforward syntax and wide community support

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

To install Python, start by downloading the installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org) for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the prompts, making sure to check the box that adds Python to your system PATH. After installation, you can verify that Python is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing python --version. To create a virtual environment, use the command python -m venv myenv and activate it with source myenv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux or myenv\Scripts\activate on Windows. This virtual environment will help you manage project-specific dependencies.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   python
print("Hello, World!")


This program uses the print function, a built-in Python function designed to display text on the screen. The text to be printed is enclosed in quotation marks and provided as an argument to the print function. Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code, which makes the code both readable and easy to maintain.


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Python features several fundamental data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Here's a simple script that shows how to use these types:

python
integer_var = 10
float_var = 10.5
string_var = "Hello, Python!"
boolean_var = True

print (integer_var, float_var, string_var, boolean_var)


integer_var holds an integer value, float_var contains a floating-point number, string_var is a string, and boolean_var is a boolean value. This script demonstrates how Python handles and prints different types of data.


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   Conditional statements and loops are fundamental in Python for controlling the flow of your program. For instance, an if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on conditions:

python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")


A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values:

python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

The if-else statement checks if x is greater than 5 and prints a message accordingly, while the for loop prints numbers from 0 to 2.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help keep code organized and modular. Here’s a simple function that adds two numbers:

python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)


This add_numbers function takes two arguments, adds them, and returns the result. The function is then called with the arguments 5 and 3, and the result (8) is printed.



7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   python
 List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("List:", numbers)

 Dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print("Dictionary:", person)

 Adding a new item to the list
numbers.append(6)
print("Updated List:", numbers)

 Adding a new key-value pair to the dictionary 
person["city"] = "New York"
print("Updated Dictionary:", person)


This script demonstrates how to create and modify both lists and dictionaries. It shows adding an element to the list and a new key-value pair to the dictionary.


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors gracefully and ensure that your program continues to run smoothly even when things go wrong. Using try, except, and finally blocks helps handle exceptions by defining what to do if an error occurs and ensuring that some code is always executed. Here’s an example:

python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")


The try block contains code that may cause an exception, the except block catches and handles the specific ZeroDivisionError, and the finally block runs regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules and packages in Python help organize and manage code by grouping related functionalities. A module is a single file containing Python code, while a package is a collection of modules organized in a directory. You can import and use a module in your script using the import statement. For example, to use the math module:

python
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16 is", result)


Here, the math module is imported, and its sqrt function is used to compute the square root of 16, demonstrating how to leverage Python’s built-in functionality.


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from and writing to files in Python involves opening a file, performing operations, and then closing it. Here’s how you can read from a file:

python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:\n", content)


And writing to a file:

python
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')


In the reading script, the content of example.txt is read and printed. In the writing script, a list of strings is written to output.txt, with each string on a new line.
